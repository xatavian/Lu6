Template engine for C++ code generation

## What is Lu6

Lu6 (pronounce "Lucyx") is an atypical template engine mostly suited for C++ code generation. The observation that motivates the project is that most template engines are suited for Web Development and don't produce well indented code when it comes to C++ code generation.

Lu6 tries to generate coherant and "beautiful" code respecting indentation, as well as adding direct logic inside the templates themselves. It follows a Java-like syntax which is conveniant for class and function declarations.
